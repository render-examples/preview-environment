# Preview Environment Example

This is a sample repository to demonstrate how you can use preview environments with Render. This repository creates a static site frontend, an Express backend, and is backed by a Postgres database, as defined in the [render.yaml](render.yaml) file. [Visit our docs](https://render.com/docs/preview-environments) for more information on using preview environments. 

## Getting Started

- Fork this repository
- Synchronize the `render.yaml` file in [your dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/iacs) and wait for your services to start.
   - Note: The initial startup time takes a couple minutes. Subsequent builds are significantly faster.
- Open a new Pull Request 

Once the PR is opened you should see your preview environment deployment begin to initialize, with status updates right in the PR.
